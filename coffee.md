# Coffee

Page detailing my various coffee setups.

## Equipment

### Fellow Ode + Gen 2 burrs

Grinds really fast, needs a spray of water on the beans to reduce static mess.
Gen 2 burrs grinds much finer than the original.

### TIMEMORE C2 Portable Manual Coffee Grinder

Seems to do a fine job, haven't tested for espresso as I don't own an espresso machine.

The only complaint is screwing on the bottom basket is very loud.

### AeroPress

Consistently makes great filtered coffee. Easy to use and clean.

I mostly follow [this technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc)

### Hario Switch

Infusion + percolation brewer. Can also be used as a normal V60.

### Cafe Du Chateau French Press

Cheap french press off Amazon.
Shatters very easily. The mesh is annoying to clean.

I mostly follow [this technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8)

### Philips 3200 Series

A bean to cup coffee machine. Does a good job at making milk drinks like Cappuccino.
The drip coffee it makes is very under extracted, and I wouldn't want to drink the "espresso" it makes on its own.

## Brews

### Dancing Goats

| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Brazil  | Machado, Minas Gerais | Sitio Alto Da Serra |

#### AeroPress

| Dosage | Grind             | Water                       | Filter          |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| 65g/L  | TIMEMORE C2 at 17 | Brita filtered water at 90C | AeroPress paper |

Steep for 2 minutes, then gently swirl and press.

- Comment: Not very bitter and there's a small hint of acidity coming though. The coffee is skily smooth and very pleasant to drink, but I would not describe it as very rich or full bodied.

#### French Press

| Dosage | Grind             | Water                        | Filter |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ |
| 65g/L  | TIMEMORE C2 at 27 | Brita filtered water at 100C | N/A    |

Steep for 4 minutes, break and remove crust, steep for 5 minutes

- Comment: Not overly bitter, and you can barly feel the acidity. Is very textured, just lacks a little bit of clarity in flavour. Overall a satisfitying brew.
