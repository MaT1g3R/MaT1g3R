# Coffee

Page detailing my various coffee setups.

## Equipment

### TIMEMORE C2 Portable Manual Coffee Grinder

Seems to do a fine job, haven't tested for espresso as I don't own an espresso machine.

The only complaint is screwing on the bottom basket is very loud.

### AeroPress

Consistently makes great filtered coffee. Easy to use and clean.

I mostly follow [this technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc)

### Cafe Du Chateau French Press

Cheap french press off Amazon.
Shatters very easily. The mesh is annoying to clean.

### Philips 3200 Series

A bean to cup coffee machine. Does a good job at making milk drinks like Cappuccino.
The drip coffee it makes is very under extracted, and I wouldn't want to drink the "espresso" it makes on its own.

## Brews

### Dancing Goats

#### AeroPress

Steep for 2 minutes, then gentelly swirl and press.

- Dosage: 65g/L
- Grind Level: TIMEMORE C2 at 18
- Water: Tap water at 90C
- Filter: Generic paper filter
- Comment: Not very bitter and there's a small hint of acidity coming though. The coffee is skily smooth and very pleasant to drink, but I would not describe it as very rich or full bodied.

#### French Press

Steep for 4 minutes, break and remove crust, steep for 5 minutes

- Dosage: 65g/L
- Grind Level: TIMEMORE C2 at 27
- Water: Tap water at 100C
- Comment: Not overly bitter, and you can barly feel the acidity. Is very textured, just lacks a little bit of clarity in flavour. Overall a  satisfitying brew.
